# Summary

The week two videos are primarily motivational in nature, essentially
making a case for caring about big data. The videos use several Gartner hype cycle
reports as a source of information on trends of current and historic
interest. Following that, they discuss a number of cloud, big data, and
AI/Machine Learning trends over recent years, looking both at
currently "hot" technologies and and the evolution of the hype cycle
projects and real world adoption outcomes. They then digress into job
opportunities, before discussing computing models and research
paradigms, and wrap up with some examples of real-world big data use
cases.

## Hype Cycle

The hype cycle is an interesting tool for understanding the progress
of a technology toward utility and/or obsolescence, and the collection
of Gartner reports placing technologies on that cycle over time was
interesting. I was, however, very surprised to be left with the
impression that the course author essentially considers a technology
dead and of no further interest when it reaches the "plateau of
productivity". Working in industry, the point at which I have
generally been most interested in adopting a technology has been when
I deem it to be on the plateau, or at the very least well onto the
"slope of enlightenment".

Running enterprise IT, I do not want to invest time and money in
developing capabilities around a technology that may never reach a
point of delivering improved productivity for my users. Something that
is coming out of the trough of disillusionment and has a long period
of boring utility ahead of it is far more interesting than something
climbing the first slope or near the peak. The bar for those to
convince me to pay attention is much higher; it has to be very obvious
that it offers benefits specific to my business.

That equation is a bit different for career development. Getting in on
Linux and Open Source nearer the "technology trigger" phase in the
late 90s did position me well to build a successful career on that
foundation. Even then, if the timing of real industry adoption had
been slightly different I could easily have seen no benefit from the
choice. Perhaps it's different in academia, where the interest in your
papers and curriculum may well wane by the time the technology is
consumable for industry, but it's definitely not the perspective I'm
used to.

## Trends

The discussion of big data trends seemed largely old hat. As was
mentioned in the presentations, many of the points raised to
illustrate the explosion of available data generated, gathered, and
stored have been going on so long that the producers of the graphs
have gotten bored with them and stopped producing. Perhaps it's
because I worked at a fortune 500 software company for over a decade,
but I pretty much thought everyone knew about the exponential growth
of data, storage, and compute.

The discussion of cloud technology seemed more relevant. Not much of
it was new to me, but it still covered things I find I have to explain
to customers and clients, rather than things I expect them to
know. The ideas of public, private, and hybrid cloud systems,
differences between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and related changes in how
companies develop new capabilites are definitely still live and
interesting issues.
